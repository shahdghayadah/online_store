# GSG Shop
In this example, we are building an e-commerce store using React. We will be working with the following concepts:
* useState
* useEffect
* Props
* get Data from API `https://fakestoreapi.com/`
* Router and Params:

> Params in React Router allow you to define dynamic segments in a URL that can be used to retrieve data from a server or database. For example, if you have a route for a product page like /products/:id, you can use the :id parameter to fetch data for the specific product.

* Context for Login:
Context is a feature in React that allows you to pass data down the component tree without having to pass props down through each level. You can create a context for login to store user authentication information and protect certain routes that require authentication.
